  		I am currently pursuing a master in management at Audencia Business School. I work in the association UAM which organises humanitarian trip abroad. I lead one of this trip in Nepal. In my freetime, I enjoy practising sport especially running and tennis. I am really  looking forward to masterising computer coding.
